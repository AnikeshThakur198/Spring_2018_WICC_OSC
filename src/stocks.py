# In order to make seven figures as a college student
# you've decided to pick up the fine profession
# of trading stocks!
# Your objective is, given a list of historic stock prices
# and a bank account balance, to return a list
# containing the price that you should have bought
# and then sold the stock, and an empty list if
# you cannot afford the stock.
# Example input: [9.5, 3.4, 3.3, 5.6, 7.0]
# Example output: [3.3, 7.0]
# Assume no prices are repeated
