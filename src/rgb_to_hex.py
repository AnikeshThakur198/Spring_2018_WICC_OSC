# An up and coming app developer, your front end UI
# designer sent you the color schema, but it's all
# RGB, and you only read in hex!
# Your objective is to take three numbers representing an RGB
# color, and returning its hex equivalent (# not needed)
# Example input: 40, 56, 88
# Example output: 283858
